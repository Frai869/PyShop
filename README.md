***Task 1. Develop a function to determine the score in a game***

In the code example below, a list of game score states throughout a match is generated.
Develop the function get_score(game_stamps, offset), which will return the score at the moment of offset in the list of game_stamps.
It is necessary to understand the essence of the written code, notice the nuances, develop a function that fits in style with the existing code, preferably with adequate algorithmic complexity.


***Task 2. Develop Tests for the Game Score Determination Function***

For the get_score(game_stamps, offset) function developed in the previous task, develop unit tests using the unittest framework.
The tests should cover all possible use cases of the function, focus on testing a single case, not be repetitive, and the test names should reflect the essence of the checks being performed.
